Philip has experience in sustainable development, humanitarian settings, computational modelling, energy system design and optimisation, fieldwork and primary data collection, and quantitative and qualitative data analysis.

His work aims to inform practitioners, policymakers and the private sector in how to best provide electricity access to un- and under-served populations. Philip has research and practical experience working in a number of developing countries, both in rural areas and humanitarian setting such as refugee camps.

He currently works as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/){:target="blank"} investigating energy access in Rwanda and India, affiliated with the [Department of Physics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics) and [Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/){:target="blank"}.

For two years Philip worked with [Practical Action](https://practicalaction.org/){:target="blank"}, an international NGO which aims to alleviate poverty in developing countries. He works on the Renewable Energy for Refugees project, a collaboration between Practical Action and UNHCR, which will bring energy access to households, businesses and community facilities in three refugee camps in Rwanda. He also supported the [HEED Project](http://heed-refugee.coventry.ac.uk/){:target="blank"}, which aims to bring sustainable energy solutions to displaced people in Rwanda and Nepal.
