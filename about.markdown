<h4> Summary </h4>
Dr Philip Sandwell is a researcher and consultant specialising in energy access in developing countries focusing on the potential of renewable technologies to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity for domestic, productive, institutional and healthcare applications. His work spans topics such as electricity demand estimation, technological performance of solar PV and battery storage, integration with other generation technologies as part of hybrid systems, and analysing their impact in terms of cost, CO2 mitigation potential and service quality.

<h4> Experience and research </h4>
Philip has extensive experience in sustainable development, computational modelling, mini-grid design and optimisation, fieldwork and primary data collection, and quantitative and qualitative data analysis. His work aims to inform practitioners, policymakers and the private sector in how to best provide electricity access to un- and under-served populations. Philip has research and practical experience working in a number of developing countries both in rural areas and humanitarian setting such as refugee camps.

He developed the [CLOVER model](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/2017/supporting-rural-electrification-in-developing-countries.php){:target="blank"} for simulating, optimising and analysing rural electricity systems and investigating the implications of their deployment strategies. CLOVER has been applied to studies in South Asia, Africa and Latin America to assess the performance of renewable electricity systems for household electricity, productive energy services, power for health clinics and more. The CLOVER model is [open source, free to download](https://github.com/phil-sandwell/CLOVER){:target="blank"} and is actively being developed to increase its functionality.

For two years Philip worked with [Practical Action](https://practicalaction.org/){:target="blank"}, an international NGO which aims to alleviate poverty in developing countries. He works on the Renewable Energy for Refugees project, a collaboration between Practical Action and UNHCR, which will bring energy access to households, businesses and community facilities in three refugee camps in Rwanda.

<h4> Education </h4>
Philip completed his PhD in the Department of Physics at Imperial College London under the supervision of [Professor Jenny Nelson FRS](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jenny.nelson){:target="blank"} and [Dr Ned Ekins-Daukes](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.ekins-daukes){:target="blank"}. His thesis addressed the potential of solar technologies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in rural communities in India and was funded by the [Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/){:target="blank"} and [Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/){:target="blank"}. Previously he was awarded a First Class Honours BSc and MSci degree in Physics with Theoretical Physics, also from Imperial College London.
