<h3> CLOVER: Open source energy system modelling </h3>

Philip developed the [CLOVER model](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/2017/supporting-rural-electrification-in-developing-countries.php){:target="blank"} for simulating, optimising and analysing rural electricity systems and investigating the implications of their deployment strategies. CLOVER has been applied to studies in South Asia, Africa and Latin America to assess the performance of renewable electricity systems for household electricity, productive energy services, power for health clinics and more. The CLOVER model is [open source, free to download](https://github.com/phil-sandwell/CLOVER){:target="blank"} and is actively being developed to increase its functionality.

<h3> Sustainable livelihoods in Mahama Refugee Camp, Rwanda </h3>

Mahama Refugee Camp is home to more than 60,000 displaced people fleeing conflict in Burundi and is the largest refugee camp in Rwanda. Through his work at **Imperial College London** he investigates the potential for renewable sources to provide power to the health centre, offices and marketplace in the camp to offer sustainable livelihoods opportunities to refugee entrepreneurs. This project is in collaboration with [MeshPower](http://www.meshpower.co.rw/index.html){:target="blank"}, a local solar minigrid company, and [Strathmore University, Nairobi](https://www.strathmore.edu/serc/){:target="blank"}.

<h3> Renewable Energy for Refugees (RE4R) Project </h3>

During his time at **Practical Action** Philip designed, coordinated and analysed energy access surveys in three refugee camps in Rwanda and three IDP camps in Nepal. His research supported the project monitoring, evaluation and learning framework to assess its long-term impact for displaced communities. His proposal for a combination of sustainable energy interventions for 40,000 people, developed in collaboration with **UNHCR**, was awarded 2,000,000 EUR by the project donor for implementation in 2018-21.

The report of his work is [available here](https://practicalaction.org/knowledge-centre/resources/ensuring-refugee-camps-in-rwanda-have-access-to-sustainable-energy/){:target="blank"} or the summary brief is [available here](https://infohub.practicalaction.org/handle/11283/622055){:target="blank"}. The quantitative data gathered during the project assessment phase is available on the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/organization/practicalaction){:target="blank"}.

<h3> Voluntary work </h3>

Philip provides support for **VSO International**, one of the largest volunteering organisations worldwide which aims to provide solutions to address marginalisation and poverty through long-lasting change in the world's poorest regions. Philip helps with the design, specification and procurement of solar systems in country offices around the world and contributed to the Global Procurement Manual for sourcing energy systems.

Philip also serves as an expert reviewer for **Engineers Without Borders** <em>Engineering for People</em> and <em>Efficiency for Access</em> student design challenges.
