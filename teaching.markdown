Philip has supervised many student thesis projects investigating sustainable development, energy access, productive livelihoods and applications of renewable energy in developing countries. Many students undertake a combination of primary fieldwork, computational modelling and policy analysis during their projects. He also lectures on techno-economic analysis as part of the *Solar Energy Systems* module of the [Sustainable Energy Futures MSc course](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/mechanical-engineering/sustainable-energy-futures/){:target="blank"} at Imperial College London.
