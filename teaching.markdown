Philip has supervised many student thesis projects investigating sustainable development, energy access, productive livelihoods and applications of renewable energy in developing countries. Many students undertake a combination of primary fieldwork, computational modelling and policy analysis during their projects. Please get in touch with Philip if you would like to discuss undertaking a student research project.

He lectures on techno-economic analysis as part of the *Solar Energy Systems* module of the [Sustainable Energy Futures MSc course](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/mechanical-engineering/sustainable-energy-futures/){:target="blank"} at Imperial College London. The graduate-level degree programme aims to provide a grounding in the major features of global energy issues, sustainable energy technologies, and their interactions with economics, the environment and policy.

Philip also assists on the interdisciplinary Global Challenges courses for [Analysing Global Progress](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/horizons/module-options/1st-year-undergraduates/global-progress/){:target="blank"}, [Collecting and Understanding Data](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/centre-for-languages-culture-and-communication/imperial-horizons/module-options/1st-year-undergraduates/understanding-data/){:target="blank"} and [Innovating for Change](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/centre-for-languages-culture-and-communication/imperial-horizons/module-options/1st-year-undergraduates/innovating-change/){:target="blank"}. These courses bring undergraduate students from across the College together to tackle sustainable development challenges.
